# July: 9th: Research!

So i did a bit of research on the type of hovecraft the size and the components so i think im going for a single motor hovercraft where 1 motor does the trust upwards and forwards and then 1 servo for steering i also saw a few videos on existing ones and yeah the one i like the most was the single motor one.
